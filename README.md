# Geometry 2020

This repository is an example of useful tools for the exam of Geometry at [University of Molise](https://www2.dipmedicina.unimol.it/ingegneria-medica/). 

In the file [lib.py](code/lib.py) there are some functions in Python language, simulating the answers during the examination. I suggest to download the repository and open the file [index.html](/docs/build/html/index.html) with your browser to see the documentation.

This work is for illustrative purposes only and may contain errors or inaccuracies. All contributions are welcome. For clarification or more information you can contact me at the email address gaetano.vitale@unimol.it.
